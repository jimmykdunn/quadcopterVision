Code for visual detection of quadcopters from video feeds for use in formation control.
Languages: Python, c++, tensorFlow


#TO DO LIST

-Varying levels of zoom for faking different resolutions/distances
-Varying levels of lighting (lights on and off?)
-Varying camera angles AND drone angles
-Multiple levels of resolution for input to the CNN? Think localization with low res and then classification with high res. Great possibility for main thrust of thesis!
-Short temporal stack of frames for better detection based on propellor movements
-With a greenscreen background, automatic truth generation should be possible!
-Remember to include images with AND without drones in them!
